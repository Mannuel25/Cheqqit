# Contribution Guidelines📃

I'm glad you found your way here!. Thanks for showing interest in this project.

The following guidelines should be followed while making your contribution(s):

- If you have any feature that you'd love to be added to the app or you noticed any bug, kindly use this [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) to open an issue.

- Upon making a pull request,  your pull request should only  contain one change at a time. Raise different pull requests for the other changes you will like to make.

- Kindly be informed that any PR that modifies someone else's lines(s) of code won't be merged unless it is absolutely necessary.

- When writing your commit messages, keep it short and concise. Also, write your commit messages in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

- Contributions or any kind will be much appreciated too, be it fixing grammatical errors, fixing broken links, etc.  If the contribution is  minimal, go ahead to create a pull request, else raise an issue before making your contribution.

- Finally, if at any point you aren't clear about anything pertaining to the project, feel free to reach out to me.😁

#### Happy Contribution🥳💃
